    <pre class="contenidoCancion">
Staring out the window
at places in the starlit horizon
I'm waiting in the darkness
for arrival
but the sands of my time are running low

Lost and stranded far away from home
Peeping through window in the darkness
- parted our hearts
glowing turning circles where we go
- no, they won't let go, let go
blindour souls with raging burning madness

Out in the heavens we're ready to fight
the final conclusion is roaring inside

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
is shinning for us, anywhere in the galaxy
time is right for us to see
the world will long for liberty
the fallen heroes calling me
anywhere in the galaxy

Anywhere... in the galaxy
Anywhere... in the galaxy

And now our blood is boiling
on the edge of life
where is the place for our survivor

Up to the stars, we have come from the night
the final conclusion is roaning inside

Gaze at the stars, the glowing god of mars
is shinning for us, anywhere in the galaxy
time is right for us to see
the world will long for liberty
the fallen heroes calling me
anywhere in the galaxy

Anywhere in the galaxy
we will fight for our destiny
anywhere in the galaxy
we will always run free

Anywhere in the galaxy
anywhere in the galaxy

    <h3 class="tituloCancion">Changes</h3>
    <pre class="contenidoCancion">
I need a new direction
Another thought to serve me right
My mind has got an infection
And there's nothing that seems to help
I need to grow an island somewhere inside my head
Where nothing can disturb me
Where I am free, where I'm forever set
        
Maybe it's not important
If we are dead or alive
I never ever wanna listen to the sirens
I'm alive, still alive
        
Who says: "We are not guilty"
I say: "We never know the way it goes"
        
Changes - all around me, all inside my head
Changes - changing face, still remaining mad
Changes - an all day routine
        
Hard to enjoy the good times
Decay is what I feel
God, it's makin' me porous, vanish in haze
I wonder, wonder if I'm real
        
Newflash - under the new regulations
Non-conformity will be punished by law
Relax - and don't forget to unplug your TV set!
Sigh no more!
        
For you, you are not guilty
No, no, you're not responsible at all
        
Changes - all around me, all inside my head
Changes - changing face, still remaining mad
Changes - an all day routine
Changes - all around me, all inside my head
Changes - changing face, still remaining mad
Changes - changing systems, still insane
Changes - but the madness will remain
        
Who is the man who says I'm never gonna die?
It's a lie, it's a lie!
And who is the man who says, I never have to sigh?
It's a lie, it's a lie!
        
Oppression, resistance
We will never change our way
The island in my mind is growin'
More and more, day after day
        
Changes - all around me now, all inside me now
Changes - wanna cry no more, wanna sigh no more

    <h3 class="tituloCancion">Beyond The Black Hole</h3>
    <pre class="contenidoCancion">
I have come from so far away
From the sunlight of my home
And I have seen it's the only way
Now my sun is dead and gone
    
I raise my head in silent anger
Seems there is no place for me
The only way out is to go
Where no one's gone before
    
Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
Another universe is mine
And I can't wait until tomorrow
Ride - There's a call from deep within
No I won't return again
`Cause I will dive into the black hole
    
Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh, oh, oh ...
    
Thunder and lightning and fire
Are guiding the trip of my life
Insatiable burning desire
As into the unknown I dive
    
I raise my head in silent anger
Seems there is no place for me
The only way out is to go
Where no one's gone before
    
Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
Another universe is mine
And I can't wait until tomorrow
Ride - There is a call from deep within
I know I won't return again
`Cause I will dive into the black hole
    
Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh, oh, oh, don't wait
    
There was a trigger, for my decision
It's right behind my eyes
Into the darkness of my vision
I let my spirit rise
    
I wanna see the black hole, into the dark
I wanna dive into the black hole, down into the dark
Into the black hole, into the dark
Into the spiral, Into the dark, the dark, the dark
    
If there's a possible chance for something that can be
Called future behind the spiral
The only way to find out, is to leave the final frontier
To eternity and fly
    
I will fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
I leave the universe behind
And I can't wait until tomorrow
    
Fly - Beyond the gates of space and time
I know the universe is mine
`Cause I will dive into the black hole
    
Ride - And there's a call from deep within
I know I won't return again
`Cause I will dive into the black hole
    
Don't wait for me, 'cause I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh don't wait for me, no I won't come back
Oh, oh, oh, don't wait

    <h3 class="tituloCancion">Father And Son</h3>
    <pre class="contenidoCancion">
Did you ever want to worry
Did you ever wanna have a doubt?
You wanted the best for me
Somehow things went wrong
And it tore us apart
    
Did you ever think it was so easy
Thought my time was running out
Tried it how I wanted to
Though you did not agree
    
But I was calling for you
But I was calling for you
Calling!
Calling!
Calling!
    
Father, you can't hide, it's time to lose the pride, some day.
Take a look and see, I'm blue as I can be
    
In former days you made your own way
You found on easy way of life
But I'll be never satisfied to work from nine till five
I'm heading for more
I remember what you've said
    
But I know I won't regret
When I try to break the rules
I'm searching for my way, my own way
    
Father, you can't hide your feelings deep inside, oh, no
There's a better way for you and me today
    
I can't stand it anymore, it's only you and me
We have to talk and see
How things are gonna be, but all I want is peace
Father, Father, Father
    
Father, now it's time, we ain't losin' our minds any more
It seems so long ago, fate will bring us hope

    <h3 class="tituloCancion">From the Ashes</h3>
    <pre class="contenidoCancion">
Now the time is here again
I'm calling you my friends
from the ashes we must rise
    
and it's been for much too long
now that everything went wrong
like the eagle we must fly
    
ooh the seal is torn
the seed is sown
ooh, we are coming
    
And we rise like phoenix from the ashes
let us go where no man's gone before
and we don't need your tomorrow
we're the kids of yesterday
and our spirit will remain forevermore
    
We're rising again
    
What's the use of living in a world that changes fast
I cannot see the good side of the progress
beyond the icy glitter world
our hearts are beating fast
a storm released to hammer on the fortress
    
your time has come
ooh, your world is done
it's time to meet the maker
ooh, we are coming
    
And we rise like phoenix from the ashes
let us go where no man's gone before
and we don't need your tomorrow
we're the kids of yesterday
and our brotherhood is here forevermore
    
We're rising again

....uuh, like phoenix from the ashes
we will go where no man's gone before
    
Rise like phoenix from the ashes
let us boldly go where no man's gone before
we don't need your tomorrow
we will do it our own way
and the world belongs to us forevermore
    
We'll rise,
we will go where no man's gone before
to hell with your tomorrow
we'll do it our own way
and our spirit will remain forevermore
    
so keep your dreams of progress
you cannot win at all
the spirit will remain forevermore
    
Rising again

    <h3 class="tituloCancion">Gardens Of The Sinner</h3>
    <pre class="contenidoCancion">As the heat is rising, out there in the past
Fallen angels calling, they have come to last
they are coming out of the dark

Then the horsemen ride out
every thing groes cold
now their armies march in
Out there from the underworld

I do not want my eyes to see
I never wanted to believe

Take me to the gardens of the sinner
Bury me and let me rest in peace
now the time of truth has come for everyone
The fallen angel stands in victory

The final seal was broken
it opened up the gates
for the dark avengers
their anger kills the light and then...

I do not want my eyes to see
I never wanted to believe

Take me to the gardens of the sinner
Bury me and let me rest in peace
now the time of truth has come for everyone
The fallen angel stands in victory

As the seventh angel opened up the seal
his curse brought endless desease
and as the wind carried the deadly seed
to the minds of the doomed
they were gone for the stages of hell

Take me to the gardens of the sinner
take me down and let me rest in peace
now the time for truth has come for everyone
the fallen angel laughs and grins now...

Take me to the gardens of the sinner
Bury me and let me rest in peace
now the time of truth has come for everyone
The fallen angel stands in victory
